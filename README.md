Bring Home To Mom is a match-making and date-planning app targeted to parents. Your parents will be the one creating profiles for you, matching you up with other parent's children, and setting you guys and gals up on dates!

Team Members: Jonathan Berk, Sofie Garden, Kevin Ceballos, Tony Mai

We utilized the Agile development methodology to deliver a complete, feature-full product under a tight 7-day period. We set up the structure/backbone of our app as a team, pair-programmed on challenging logic, and worked solo to learn and implement new technologies. Individually, we worked on vertical slices (separate features) to ensure minimal Git workflow conflicts, and when conflicts arose, we resolved them systematically.

Personally, I took responsibility for learning and integrating two important functions â€“ cloud image hosting (using Cloudinary) and real-time messaging (using Faye). I navigated a pair-programming partner through AJAX-ifying several logic-heavy pages to create a better user experience.

We solidified our knowledge on existing technologies while learning new APIs (Stripe, Twilio, Cloudinary, Rotten Tomatoes, and OMBD).

Some of the technologies/frameworks we used include:
* Ruby on Rails
* PostgreSQL
* Javascript
* JQuery
* AJAX
* handlebars.js
* Faye messaging system
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Responsive Grid System
* Stripe API
* Twilio API
* Cloudinary API
* Rotten Tomatoes API
* OMDB API

Some of the features include:
* Create child profiles
* Smart matching system based on filters and interests
* Autocomplete
* Dates dashboard
* Design a date page
* Choose a date experience
* Real-time messaging system
* Pre-fund dates
* Text notifications
* Responsive design
* Asynchronous updates for best user experience and minimal page reloads
